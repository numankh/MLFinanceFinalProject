# MLFinanceFinalProject

Final project for COMS4995: ML with Applications to Finance at Columbia University

The goal of the project was to use historical data from the last five years of a
selection of stocks to compare portfolio optimization or algorithmic trading models optimized
using at least three of the following popular machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision
trees, support vector machine, bagging, boosting, random forest, Markovian model,
Bayesian model, neural networks, and deep learning:

The portfolio optimization models explored in the Jupyter Notebook (FinalProject.ipynb) were the following:
- Mean-Variance Optimization
- Index model
- Capital asset pricing model (CAPM)
- Arbitrage pricing theory and multifactor model
- Black Litterman model
